# Steps to build
1. Install nodejs. Install grunt globally ( `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli` )
2. From the root folder, run `npm install` and then `grunt build`
3. Files will be generated in the `dist` folder, and the packaged extension in the packages folder.

How to Use Recall:
1. In the chrome navigation address bar, type recall <space> query. The auto-completion will show matching pages already visited based on the page metadata and will display the matching results. If there is no match for the query, google search will be performed instead.
2. Upon installation of the recall app, the bookmarks are auto-indexed for search.
